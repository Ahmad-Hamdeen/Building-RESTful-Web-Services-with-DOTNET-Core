## About the Book
REST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become synonymous with APIs. The depth, breadth, and ease of use of ASP.NET Core, makes it a breeze for developers to work with it to build robust Web APIs. This book will take you through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the ASP.NET Core Framework to implement these services.
This book begins with introducing you to the basics of the philosophy behind REST, you'll go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. This book takes a practical approach and with each chapter provides you with code samples that you can apply to your own circumstances. This book brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release, working with MVC. Later you understand the use of the framework to explore approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. You will explore the steps to improve the performance of your applications with the new HTTP 2.0 standards. You'll also learn techniques to deal with security in Web APIs and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies.
By the end of the book, you will have a complete understanding of building a .NET client for your RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 9 and 11 do not have code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
<?xml version = "1.0"?>
  <SOAP-ENV:Envelope 
  xmlns:SOAP-ENV = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope" 
  SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding">
  ...
  SOAP Message information goes here
  ...
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```
